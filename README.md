# CODE ALONG NOTES

Implement state and setState logic to flip the card

## STEPS

- Create a Card component to house both the CardFront and CardBack component
- Edit the App.jsx to map recipes into individual Card components
- Edit the App.module.scss to display cards as a grid
- Style the Card so you can either see the front or back (by adding or removing the faceDown css class)
- Create the initial state object with isFaceDown: false
- Attach flipCard method to onclick for the whole card (this method will update the state)
- Show trainees state change in React devtools
- Add conditional styling so faceDown css class is added or removed on state change
