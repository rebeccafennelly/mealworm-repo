# CHALLENGE NOTES

## Create a form so users can upload custom recipes

- Create an additional page in MealWorm and a link to it from the NavBar
- Create a form on this page with fields for all the properties needed to put a recipe into the database
- Once the user has completed the form they should be able to put the new recipe into the database

### Extension

- Add form validation so that the user cannot submit a recipe without all of the required fields completed
