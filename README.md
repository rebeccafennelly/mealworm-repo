# CHALLENGE NOTES

## Create a form so users can upload custom recipes

- Create an additional page in MealWorm and a link to it from the NavBar
- Create a form on this page with fields for all the properties needed to put a recipe into the database
- Once the user has completed the form they should be able to submit the new recipe into the database

Once the functionality has been implemented you should be able to add a recipe and then view it in the /cookbook page

### Extension

- Add form validation so that the user cannot submit a recipe without all of the required fields completed
