Create a fetch that calls the catfacts.ninja API and displays the returned data in any way you choose

- Read the docs here: https://catfact.ninja/docs
- You will need to have a good read of the docs to find out how to return mroe than one fact at a time
- Test the API in postman before trying to call it in react
- The MVP is to get 10 facts appearing on the page as sentences

### Extension

- GET CREATIVE! Display the returned facts in a creative way that actually makes this interesting to the user
- Allow the user to input how many they want to see at any one time
