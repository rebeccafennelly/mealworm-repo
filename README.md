# CHALLENGE NOTES

Following the pattern from the context-code-along branch create a recipe context file that handles the calls to the MealDB external api. You'll need to:

- Create the context & provider in a new file in src/context
- Move any logic related to the fetch and returned recipes into this context
- Consume and methods or returned data in the appropriate components

This will be a refactor of the application so once you have completed the challenge successfully the codebase will have changed but the functionality as far as the user is concerned won't.
